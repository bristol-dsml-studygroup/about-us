### Q: I am a complete beginner in Machine Learning and Data Science - is the group for me?
Yes. A basic level of programming experience will be handy. The industry and courses are typically using Python, R, or C++. Some learners find that they can learn the concept of machine learning and at the same time pick up the programming language. This is particularly true for Python or R.

### Q: I am a professional Data Scientist or Machine Learning Expert - is the group for me?
Yes. Your experience and time will be gladly welcomed by this group. You could consider volunteering your time to be a facilitator and provide peer support. Or join us to learn something new.

### Q: I already started and / or finished the Fast.ai course. What should I do next?
There are many other free online courses, feel free to suggest them to us via an email to bristol.dsml.studygroup@gmail.com. This will encourage our learners to look into other courses. Your experience will also be very helpful in providing support to our learners. 

### Q: I cannot attend your meetings regularly, but would love to. What can I do?
You do not need to attend regularly, even though we encourage everyone to do so. This is a self-paced peer support group, feel free to be empowered to learn at your own pace. 

### Q: The scheduled day of week and time does not work for me. What can I do?
At the moment, this is the only time available due to venue restrictions, we are relying on Desklodge sponsoring regular free space. The material or learnings gathered in the [Github](https://github.com/bristol-dsml-studygroup) are free for anyone to use.

### Q: Someone did not observe the code of conduct. What should I do?
Please report to the facilitator/organiser at the first instance. You can also email bristol.dsml.studygroup@gmail.com.

No, if it is a work project. The main focus of the group is to focus on open source courses to gain knowledge. However, if you would like to suggest any open source learning courses for the group, please get in touch, bristol.dsml.studygroup@gmail.com.
