# About Courses
## [deeplearning.ai: *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)
- This course approach the topic theory first, code later.
- Code:
  - Python
  - build simple Neural Network(NN) from scratch
  - build NN from *Tensorflow*, NOT *Tensorflow2*

## [fast.ai: *Practical Deep Learning for Coders*](https://course.fast.ai/)
- This course approach topic code first, theory later.
- Code:
  - Python
  - build NN from *fastai* library, built on *PyTorch*
